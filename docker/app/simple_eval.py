# Before running more-advanced experiments, I want to test for feasibility. 
# In an advanced evaluation, sampling should reflect the automaton's 
# experience, with the GAN being trained on only the observed real data. 
# In this simple evaluation, the GAN will not be trained--I need to 
# justify the engineering work first. The GAN is trained on a single, 
# large dataset. The evaluation will work as follows.
# 1. Sample data, pooling simulants with real. 
# 2. Fit the q-net 
# 3. Generate the metric: %-wins of game trials
